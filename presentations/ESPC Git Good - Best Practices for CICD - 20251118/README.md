# ESPC Webinar: Git Good - Best Practices for CI/CD and Collaboration in Microsoft Fabric

### Session Follow‑Up, Q&A, and Resources

This folder contains the follow-up material from my session **"Git
Good: Best Practices for CI/CD and Collaboration in Microsoft Fabric."** from the 18th of November 2025.

The session covered: 
- Workspace and repository organization
- Infrastructure setup using Python and the Fabric CLI
- Git integration strategies in Microsoft Fabric
- Branching patterns for collaborative development
- CI/CD automation using **fabric-cicd**
- Deployment approaches, environment alignment, and best practices
- Real-world lessons learned from building Fabric data platforms

A lot of excellent questions came in during the session - more than we had time to address live.  
To make sure nothing was lost, I collected **all questions + full answers** into a dedicated Q&A document.
