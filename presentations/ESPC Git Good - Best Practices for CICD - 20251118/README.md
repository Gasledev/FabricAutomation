### Session Follow‑Up, Q&A, and Resources

This folder contains the follow-up material from my session **"Git
Good: Best Practices for CI/CD and Collaboration in Microsoft Fabric."**

The session covered: 
- Workspace and repository organization\
- Git integration strategies in Microsoft Fabric\
- Branching patterns for collaborative development\
- CI/CD automation using **fabric-cicd**\
- Deployment approaches, environment alignment, and best practices\
- Real-world lessons learned from building Fabric data platforms

A lot of excellent questions came in during the session --- more than we
had time to address live.\
To make sure nothing was lost, I collected **all questions + full
answers** into a dedicated document.
